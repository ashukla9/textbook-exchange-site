# Textbook Exchange Site/App

As a final project for an advanced CS class, created an app for students to buy and sell used textbooks. We used Firebase for the backend, and Dart and the Flutter SDK for the frontend.

Some of our features included a login/logout, signup, cart, the ability to add and delete textbooks, and a filter/search option. The "database_practice" folder contains the final app.
